    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile application
      (<strong>the App</strong>). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)</h3>
    <p>
      We use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send important notifications such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ramadan confirmation</li>
      <li>Eid announcements</li>
      <li>Important Islamic news and app updates</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These notifications are sent as general broadcasts to all users.
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or manage individual user FCM tokens manually.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Location Information</h3>
    <p>
      The App may request access to your device’s location solely for functional purposes, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculating accurate Athan (prayer) times based on your region</li>
      <li>Determining Qibla direction</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, track, or share your location data.
      All location usage happens locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Online Audio Content</h3>
    <p>
      The App allows users to play Surah (Qur’an recitations) streamed from online sources.
      We do not collect personal data related to audio playback.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Prayer Time Sources</h3>
    <p>
      Athan and prayer times are obtained from trusted Islamic sources, including
      <a href="https://acju.lk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acju.lk</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Home Screen Widgets & Background Services</h3>
    <p>
      The App uses background alarm services to refresh home screen widgets so users can view Athan times
      without opening the App. No personal data is collected through this feature.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Device Features</h3>
    <p>
      The App may use certain device features to improve user experience, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>System theme detection (light/dark mode)</li>
      <li>Vibration for Tasbeeh counter feedback and notifications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These features do not involve collecting or storing personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, the App does not display advertisements.
      In the future, advertisements may be introduced as a source of income.
      If ads are added, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell, trade, or share users’ personal information with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App is designed for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
      Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
    </p>
